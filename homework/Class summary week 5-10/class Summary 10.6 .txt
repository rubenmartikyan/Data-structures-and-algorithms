Class Summary 10.06

Today was the code implementation of of the sorting algorithms which we covered during previous classes.
As an in class activity we did Selection sort, and the bubble sort was given as homework.
Most of the code was clear to me, however due to the lack of knowledge of the language C I had difficulties understanding the algorithm written
in that form.
Due to that I took all of my will powers in my hand and went to the OH with Narine :D
Narine explained several key factors which were needed to undersand the C language and now I understand the algorithm in C a little bit less bad.
Most likely until the end of the semester I will have the key knowledge to implement algorithms in C.
See you in next summar.
