Class Summary 29.09

Even though I was late from the class I was able to understand the majority of the lecture.
Presumably the class started from the explanation of the linked list.
Linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement memory.
The way it works is that it has a node which points from one element to the other.
Collection of nodes together assemble a data structure and it represents a sequence.
Each element has to have at least data and a reference to its previous and next elements.
The key factore of linked list is that each element can only be accessed in particular order.
One of the best real life examples for easier visualization is the roll of paper as it has to be unrolled to get to the specific point of it.
We have discussed the circular linked list as well
Below you can see my visualization of the circular example :)
All of the elements have nodes to their previous and next and the last elements next elements is the first elements preious.

After understanding the linked list we went on to continue the discussions about the complexity of algorithms.
This time we covered an example of simplest logarithmic algorithm which complexity was LogN.
