Class Review 01.10

The class was an overview about sorting algorithms.
We were shared 5 ways of soring algorthms out of which 2 we were able to discuss during the class:
-Selection sort
-Bubble sort
During the class we discussed the unique ways of the execution of this algrithms and its usages.
Both algorithms have their own aspects. Throughout the class we discussed the general forms of it (a-an) and did
our own handwritten examples on the whiteboard on the simple examples made from couple of numbers. This helped me
to understand the sorting algorithms a lot better.
I would like to highlight the fact that the sequence with which the explanations of these algorithms were on the slides
as it made whole a lot sense.
Sadly we had no time to cover all of them in one class but I hope I will not forget the way these algorithms function
untill the next class.
