Class Summary 04.10

Today was the continuation of the class of sorting algorithms. We did a revisions of the bubble sort and selection sort
which we covered during the class of 01.10.
This time we covered insertion sort and did several examples of all these to understand the differences of
these algorithms a lot better. Of course we covered the complexity of these algorithms which were O(n^2).
Lastly during the last 20 minutes of the class we covered the merge sort, which was the most satisfying and disturbing
algorthm at the same time. The best part of merge sort is that its complexity is O(nLog(n)) which we know from
basic calculus is smaller than n^2.
Lastly we were left with the quick sort which we were not able to cover as we were low on time.
But out of all these classes during these semester this and the last one were the only ones which were 100% 
understandable.
